  <h1>Here are some bands that I like and why:</h1>
  <h2><a href="https://youtu.be/aTAaEHiGjvU">Nightwish</a></h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Three different vocalists, each with their own distinct sounds:</li>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Tarja Turunen</strong>, Finnish singer classically trained in Operatic style</li>
      <li><strong>Anette Olzon</strong>, a more pop-ish Swedish singer, great accent to the darker tones of the band</li>
      <li><strong>Floor Jansen</strong>, Dutch vocal instructor and presently has frontlined at least four bands. Can sing anything.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Incredible blend of heavy metal and symphonic opera. Like mixing mint and orange, except it's amazing.</li>
    <li>Still making music - they have albums dating back as far as 1996, and the most recent album came out 2020.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2><a href="https://youtu.be/tkbgtVFlyCQ">Pearl Jam</a></h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Classic rock feel, one of the powerhouses of grunge</li>
    <li>Though Eddie Vedder is near-unintelligible at times, his crooning is emotional and songs hit the heart.</li>
    <li>Entire <em>Ten</em> album is available for Rock Band 3</li>
  </ul>
  <h2><a href="https://youtu.be/cdiY6kijYHE">Explosions In The Sky</a></h2>
  <img src="img/EITS.jpg" width="200px">
  <ul>
    <li>Instrumental band featured heavily in the movie <em>Friday Night Lights</em></li>
    <li>Very good sound to just chill out or practice guitar</li>
    <li>Originally from Texas, they've since toured the world</li>
  </ul>
